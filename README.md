# Todo (Django-React-Docker-SQL-AWS)

## Introduction:
A simple todo app made with Django, React & SQLite3.

React frontend was cloned from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) and modified to interact with the Django REST API.

Dockerised then deployed to AWS EC2.

## Instructions:

Ensure you have Docker installed. You can get Docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Then run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/chelsejw/todo
cd todo
docker-compose up
```

If there are no errors, you should be able to view the app on [127.0.0.1](127.0.0.1)!

This app is also deployed on [AWS EC2](http://ec2-13-229-51-142.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com/).

## Notes:

Special thanks to the Deloitte team for this assignment, which gave me the opportunity to learn how to deploy to AWS EC2 and make Docker apps.
